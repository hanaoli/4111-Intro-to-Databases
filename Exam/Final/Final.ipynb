    "1. Structured data: high degree of organization, all records for a given type have the same fields, the fields are strongly typed and there are integrity constraints on values, e.g. NOT NULL, the relational model is the cannonical example: there is data defnition language (DDL), instances of data must match the DDL in the same way objets match the class definition. Examples of structured data: name, age, gender. Sources of structured data: SQL databass, spreadsheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Semi-structured data: there are records with fields, you can parse the data to extract records and fields into data structures, records may have some common fields, but any record may have any fields of any types. Documents are the canonical example: thre are common structural concepts: headers, lists, footnotes. CouchDB is an example of a document database. It stores semi-structured JSON documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unstructured data: no explicit records or delimiters. No fields, no properties. Just a sequence of characters/bytes than can be interpreted by some processing engine. Images, audio fiels, etc are examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Metadata: Metadata is \"data information that provides information about other data\". Three distincy types of metadata exist: descriptive metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata. Descriptive metadata describes a resource for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.Structural metadata is metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships and other characteristics of digital materials. Administrative metadata provides information to help manage a resource, such as when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. BLOB: A Binary Large OBject (BLOB) is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob.It is a large object data type in the database system. BLOB could store a large chunk of data, document types and even media files like audio or video files. BLOB fields allocate space only whenever the content in the field is utilized. BLOB allocates spaces in Giga Bytes.\n",

   "source": [
    "1. Functional dependency: A functional dependency (FD) is a relationship between two attributes, typically between the PK and other non-key attributes within a table. For any relation R, attribute Y is functionally dependent on attribute X (usually the PK), if for every valid instance of X, that value of X uniquely determines the value of Y. This relationship is indicated by the representation below : X ———–> Y. The left side of the above FD diagram is called the determinant, and the right side is the dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data redundancy and update anomaly: In database design, redundancy is generally undesirable because it causes problems maintaining consistency after updates. However, redundancy can sometimes lead to performance improvements; for example, when redundancy can be used in place of a join to connect data. A join is used when you need to obtain information based on two related tables. If a branch changes address, such as the Round Hill branch in Figure 10.3, we need to update all rows referring to that branch. Changing existing information incorrectly is called an update anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decomposition: Decomposition is the process of breaking down in parts or elements.It replaces a relation with a collection of smaller relations. It breaks the table into multiple tables in a database. It should always be lossless, because it confirms that the information in the original relation can be accurately reconstructed based on the decomposed relations. If there is no proper decomposition of the relation, then it may lead to problems like loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. BCNF: Boyce-Codd Normal Form or BCNF is an extension to the third normal form, and is also known as 3.5 Normal Form.or a table to satisfy the Boyce-Codd Normal Form, it should satisfy the following two conditions: It should be in the Third Normal Form. And, for any dependency A → B, A should be a super key. In simple words, it means, that for a dependency A → B, A cannot be a non-prime attribute, if B is a prime attribute. If a relational schema is in BCNF then all redundancy based on functional dependency has been removed, although other types of redundancy may still exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. First Normal Form and atomic domain: A database is in first normal form if it satisfies the following conditions: Contains only atomic values, There are no repeating groups.A table is in 1 NF iff: There should be Single Valued Attributes.Attribute Domain should not change. There should be Unique name for Attributes/Columns. The order in which data is stored, does not matter. An atomic value is a value that cannot be divided. \n",

    "1. Elevator Algorithm is a disk-scheduling algorithm to determine the motion of the disk's arm and head in servicing read and write requests. Since this algorithm works as an elevator, it known as elevator algorithm. The advantages of this algorithm are high throughput, low variance of response time, and average response time. However, the disadvantage is that long wating time for requests for locaitons just visited by disk arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clock is a more efficient version of FIFO than Second-chance because pages don't have to be constantly pushed to the back of the list, but it performs the same general function as Second-Chance. The clock algorithm keeps a circular list of pages in memory, with the \"hand\" (iterator) pointing to the last examined page frame in the list. When a page fault occurs and no empty frames exist, then the R (referenced) bit is inspected at the hand's location. If R is 0, the new page is put in place of the page the \"hand\" points to, and the hand is advanced one position. Otherwise, the R bit is cleared, then the clock hand is incremented and the process is repeated until a page is replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. a)Buffering of blocks in memory (memory means RAM, main memory hereafter) – the major goal of a DBMS is to minimize the number of disk block transfers between the memory and the disk. Buffering involves allocation of memory space in the main memory to hold some of the blocks which can be retained for future use in case if that blocks are needed frequently. We want to do this for as many blocks as possible. There are several ideas to choose the important or frequently needed blocks. These are done by the Buffer Manager. b)Nonvolatile Write Buffers – main memory is volatile, ie., losses data due to power failure. For this case, we would use a Non-volatile Random Access Memory (NV-RAM) which is backed by the battery power. The pending buffer writes due to a system crash or sudden power failure can be easily handled using this technique. c)Scheduling – it is about transferring the data in the order in which they are stored. The idea is to reduce the disk-arm movement. For example, let us suppose that there are several block requests initiated. And at that time the disk read-write head is exactly over the innermost track of a disk platter. Now the idea is to move disk arm towards the outermost track so that we can transfer the required blocks on the way instead of accessing back and forth. \n",

    "4. We can store credit card information and separate them into before 2016 and after 2016. For after 2016, we will use it more often so that we can put it in a fast disk while for transactions before 2016, we will probably not going to use it so we will put it in a slow disk. This can optimize for storage cost and read performance. We will have a fast reading and better performance for transactions after 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Columnar storage for database tables is an important factor in optimizing analytic query performance because it drastically reduces the overall disk I/O requirements and reduces the amount of data you need to load from disk. Using columnar storage, each data block stores values of a single column for multiple rows. As records enter the system, Amazon Redshift transparently converts the data to columnar storage for each of the columns. In this simplified example, using columnar storage, each data block holds column field values for as many as three times as many records as row-based storage. This means that reading the same number of column field values for the same number of records requires a third of the I/O operations compared to row-wise storage. In practice, using tables with very large numbers of columns and very large row counts, storage efficiency is even greater.\n",

    "1. a)The B+ tree can contain more nodes per node for two reasons, one is to reduce the height of the tree. The other is to change the data range into multiple intervals. The more the interval, the faster the data retrieval. b)Support range query, and partial range query is very efficient, each node can index a larger and more accurate range, which means that the B+ tree single disk IO information is larger than the B-tree, and the I/O efficiency is higher. c)The leaf nodes are linked to each other by two or two pointers, and the sequential query performance is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A covering index is a non-clustered index which includes all columns referenced in the query and therefore, the optimizer does not have to perform an additional lookup to the table in order to retrieve the data requested. As the data requested is all indexed by the covering index, it is a faster operation. To be considered as a covering index, all columns referenced by the query must be contained in the index. So this means all columns in the SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING etc etc. The covering index helps us to avoid the round trip to the table to satisfy the request, since all of the columns requested exist in the non-clustered index itself. This greatly reduces logical and physical reads, hence boosting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In B+ Tree, if a record moves, all secondary indices that store record pointers have to be updated. So a write intensive workload would make node splits in B+ Tree file organizations become extremely expensive. For example, if we are doing an update, we have to update indexes and datafiles so basically there are two writes. Moreover, as the tree goes, we are constantly spliting and rebalancing and that will become complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The log-structured merge-tree (or LSM tree) is a data structure with performance characteristics that make it attractive for providing indexed access to files with high insert volume, such as transactional log data. LSM trees, like other search trees, maintain key-value pairs. LSM trees maintain data in two or more separate structures, each of which is optimized for its respective underlying storage medium; data is synchronized between the two structures efficiently, in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Index Key Compression allows us to compress portions of the key values in an index segment (or Index Organized Table), by reducing the storage inefficiencies of storing repeating values. It compresses the data by splitting the index key into two parts; the leading group of columns, called the prefix entry (which are potentially shared across multiple key values), and the suffix columns (which is unique to every index key). As the prefixes are potentially shared across multiple keys in a block, these can be stored more optimally (that is, only once) and shared across multiple suffix entries, resulting in the index data being compressed. Index Key compression is done in the leaf blocks of a B-Tree index. The keys are compressed locally within an index leaf block, that is, both the prefix and suffix entries are stored within same block. Suffix entries form the compressed representation of the index key. Each one of these compressed rows refers to the corresponding prefix, which is stored in the same block. By storing the prefixes and suffixes locally in the same block, each index block is self-contained and in order to construct the complete key there is no additional block IO involved. It is a very cheap memory only operation and will reduce storage.\n",

    "The ratio of unique values within a key column is referred to as index selectivity. The more unique the values, the higher the selectivity, which means that a unique index has the highest possible selectivity. The query engine loves highly selective key columns, especially if those columns are referenced in the WHERE clause of your frequently run queries. The higher the selectivity, the faster the query engine can reduce the size of the result set. The flipside, of course, is that a column with relatively few unique values is seldom a good candidate to be indexed. There is separate indexes on home phone and mobile phone because they are separate and non-compound indexes so we can only use one of them (home phone/mobile phone). So there are two indexes and we will pick the most selective indexes.\n",

    "1. A phantom read occurs when, in the course of a transaction, two identical queries are executed, and the collection of rows returned by the second query is different from the first. Phantom reads are when reading from committed INSERTS and/or DELETES from another transaction. There are new rows or rows that have disappeared since you began the transaction. We will do range blocking on index. We will put a lock on a range of values that applied to all the rows in the range and pervent inserts into the range itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimistic concurrency control (OCC) is a concurrency control method applied to transactional systems such as relational database management systems and software transactional memory. OCC assumes that multiple transactions can frequently complete without interfering with each other. While running, transactions use data resources without acquiring locks on those resources. Before committing, each transaction verifies that no other transaction has modified the data it has read. If the check reveals conflicting modifications, the committing transaction rolls back and can be restarted. For optimistic concurrency control, the strength is: Transactions are executed more efficiently. Data content is relatively safe. Throughput is much higher. Its weakness is: There is a risk of data interference among concurrent transactions since it transactions conflict may occur during execution. In this case, data is no longer correct. Database may have some hidden errors with inconsistent data; even conflict check is performed at the end of transactions. Transactions may be in deadlock that causes the system to hang.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. T1: R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W1(B) T2: R2(A), W2(A), R2(B), W2(B) S1: R1(A), W1(A), R2(A), W2(A), R1(B), W1(B), R2(B), W2(B) -> Swapping non-conflicting operations R2(A) and R1(B) in S1, the schedule becomes, S11: R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W2(A), R2(A), W1(B), R2(B), W2(B) -> Similarly, swapping non-conflicting operations W2(A) and W1(B) in S11, the schedule becomes, S12: R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W1(B), R2(A), W2(A), R2(B), W2(B). S12 is a serial schedule in which all operations of T1 are performed before starting any operation of T2. Since S has been transformed into a serial schedule S12 by swapping non-conflicting operations of S1, S1 is conflict serializable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cascading Abort: A situation in which the abort of one transaction forces the abort of another transaction to prevent the second transaction from reading invalid (uncommitted) data. Also called \"cascading rollback\". A cascading rollback occurs in database systems when a transaction (T1) causes a failure and a rollback must be performed. Other transactions dependent on T1's actions must also be rollbacked due to T1's failure, thus causing a cascading effect. That is, one transaction's failure causes many to fail. To avoid cascading rollback, follow a modified protocol called Strict Two-phase locking (S2PL) that a transaction must holds all its exclusive locks till it commits/aborts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ACID: Atomicity: Either the task (or all tasks) within a transaction are performed or none of them are. This is the all-or-none principle. If one element of a transaction fails the entire transaction fails. Consistency: The transaction must meet all protocols or rules defined by the system at all times. The transaction does not violate those protocols and the database must remain in a consistent state at the beginning and end of a transaction; there are never any half-completed transactions. Isolation: No transaction has access to any other transaction that is in an intermediate or unfinished state. Thus, each transaction is independent unto itself. This is required for both performance and consistency of transactions within a database. Durability: Once the transaction is complete, it will persist as complete and cannot be undone; it will survive system failure, power loss and other types of system breakdowns. BASE: Basically Available: This constraint states that the system does guarantee the availability of the data as regards CAP Theorem; there will be a response to any request. But, that response could still be ‘failure’ to obtain the requested data or the data may be in an inconsistent or changing state, much like waiting for a check to clear in your bank account. Soft state: The state of the system could change over time, so even during times without input there may be changes going on due to ‘eventual consistency,’ thus the state of the system is always ‘soft.’ Eventual consistency: The system will eventually become consistent once it stops receiving input. The data will propagate to everywhere it should sooner or later, but the system will continue to receive input and is not checking the consistency of every transaction before it moves onto the next one. Werner Vogel’s article “Eventually Consistent – Revisited” covers this topic is much greater detail.\n",

    "1. Because the view is running the previous query every time we execute it and so it is reconstructing everything. For each of the query, it is reruning the compelx query. The copy table is just querying the data, so it is not reruning the query that building the data every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because views are automatically updated and they are always current.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Security - Views can be made accessible to users while the underlying tables are not directly accessible. This allows the DBA to give users only the data they need, while protecting other data in the same table. Simplicity - Views can be used to hide and reuse complex queries. Column Name Simplication or Clarification - Views can be used to provide aliases on column names to make them more memorable and/or meaningful. Stepping Stone - Views can provide a stepping stone in a \"multi-level\" query. For example, you could create a view of a query that counted the number of sales each salesperson had made. You could then query that view to group the sales people by the number of sales they had made.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We will use trigger in SQL. A database trigger is special stored procedure that is run when specific actions occur within a database.  Most triggers are defined to run when changes are made to a table’s data.  Triggers can be defined to run instead of or after DML (Data Manipulation Language) actions such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n",
